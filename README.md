# Air travel

Air travel is considered the most, efficient, safe, and well known methods of transportation, especially for such travels which are very distant from their original location. As it is the summer season,hundreds and thousands of people will be using air travel to visit their family, friends, and/or to spend a peaceful time away from their hectic daily lives. Airlines and air travel agencies help connect people around the globe using aviation managment systems. In this project, I have implemented a program that loads text files representing various airports and flights around the world and analyzes the flight. I als provide the details of the air travels, which finds the city and country flights along with the connecting flights, gets the code of the airport and provides with the user with all of the data
